    <h2 id="revision">Revising Your Draft</h2>

    <p>After receiving feedback from peer review (or your ASC tutor visit), your next step is to revise your draft with a focus on the ideas and structure of your paper. This means looking at how your analysis is organized, whether your points are fully developed, and how well your evidence supports your claims.</p>

    <p>Some questions to guide your revision:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Does the overall organization of your paper make sense? Are your ideas presented in a logical order?</li>
      <li>Are your convention paragraphs fully developed with enough analysis and evidence?</li>
      <li>Are you using your genre samples effectively to support your points — and using more than one example per convention to show a pattern?</li>
      <li>Do your paragraphs connect to each other with transitions, or does the paper feel choppy?</li>
      <li>Does your introduction set up the paper clearly, and does your conclusion bring your analysis together?</li>
      <li>Did your peer reviewers flag anything that you haven't addressed yet?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>This Is a Second Draft, Not a Final Draft</h3>
      <p>You will have more opportunities to improve this paper. After submitting this revised draft, you will meet with me for an <b>individual conference</b> where I'll give you direct feedback on your essay. At the end of the semester, you will revise this paper one more time as part of your <b>Final Portfolio</b>.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">So for this draft, focus on making meaningful revisions to your ideas, organization, flow, and structure. It doesn't need to be perfect — but it should show real progress from your rough draft.</p>
