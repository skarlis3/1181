      <h3>At a Glance</h3>
      <p>This is your revised Genre Analysis Essay, submitted after receiving feedback from peer review (or the ASC tutor). Your revision should go beyond proofreading — it should focus on high- and middle-order concerns like organization, flow, transitions, use of evidence, and paragraph development.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">The revised draft must meet all requirements listed on this page, including word count, formatting, evidence, citations, and the required topics from the <a href="genre-analysis.html">Genre Analysis Essay</a> assignment page.</p>

    <h2 id="revision">What "Effectively Revised" Means</h2>

    <p>Your revised draft should show meaningful changes based on the feedback you received during peer review (or from your ASC tutor visit). Revision means rethinking and improving the substance and structure of your paper — not just fixing surface-level errors.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Revision vs. Proofreading</h3>
      <p><b>Revision</b> focuses on the bigger picture: reorganizing sections, strengthening your analysis, adding or reworking evidence, improving transitions, developing underdeveloped paragraphs, and clarifying your argument.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><b>Proofreading</b> focuses on surface-level cleanup: fixing typos, correcting grammar, and adjusting formatting. Proofreading is appreciated, but <b>proofreading alone will not fulfill the revision requirement.</b></p>
    </div>

          <li>For shorter genres, such as Discord messages, I recommend using a series of messages from three separate conversations.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Use more than one sample/example to support each convention, since you are trying to show a trend.</li>

      <li><b>In-text citations:</b> Clearly state the username/name of the creator of the post or message you are analyzing.</li>

    <h2 id="ai">AI Statement of Use</h2>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>Required for All Students</h3>
      <p>Include a detailed AI Statement of Use at the end of your paper, regardless of whether you used AI or not.</p>
      <p><b>If you did not use GenAI:</b> State that you did not use GenAI in any capacity.</p>
      <p><b>If you used GenAI in any capacity</b>, your statement must include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which AI tool was used (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, etc.)</li>
        <li>Which pages or paragraphs the AI assisted with</li>
        <li>What specific tasks the AI helped you with for those sections (e.g., brainstorming, revising for clarity, proofreading)</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">You may use GenAI to help write your AI Statement of Use, but you are responsible for making sure it is accurate and truthful.</p>
